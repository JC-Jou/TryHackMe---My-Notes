Summary:

Quantification of campaign plans into documents and preparation for a successful Red Team engagement – Planning Phase
Objective #1: Meet the client's goals.
Planning and documentation are critical for the success of the engagement!

In this chapter, we went over the information that needs to be summarized for the Red Team operation in order to succeed in the mission.
Among other things, I reviewed the components and functions of a Red Team engagement, proper engagement planning based on needs and resources,
and time-frame plans. I learned that it is necessary to clearly summarize the client’s objectives and the Red Team boundaries,
and to write down what the client’s goals are and the areas that are off-limits or allowed to touch.

These are legal documents:
I saw an example of a RoE document, i.e., Rules of Engagement.
This is a document that grants approval to a penetration tester, defines the objectives the engagement addresses, and the behaviors/techniques that are permitted and/or forbidden.
It is also possible to use a Non-Disclosure Agreement (external agreement or other confidentiality agreements).

These are operational documents:
I saw tables with headers of the information that needs to be prepared before starting the Red Team operation: details about the Red Team engagement, actions and tools that will be used, tasks and execution timelines, and a remediation plan after completing the tasks.
I saw what needs to be included in a CONOPS document – Concept of Operations. Its purpose is to provide information to gain a general understanding of everything that is happening. I saw examples of CONOPS.
The second document in the intervention plan is the resource plan – which people to use and which tools.
After that, there is the action plan – the overall planning.
And the mission plan – detailed instructions for the Red Team on the exact actions the operators must perform.
